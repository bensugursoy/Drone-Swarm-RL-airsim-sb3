# Drone Swarm Reinforcement Learning with AirSim and StableBaselines3 ðŸš€

![Drone Swarm](https://example.com/drone-swarm-image.png)

Welcome to the **Drone-Swarm-RL-airsim-sb3** repository! This project focuses on training drone swarms using cutting-edge technologies such as StableBaselines3, PettingZoo, AirSim, and Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). Our aim is to develop efficient algorithms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) that can control multiple drones in a simulated environment.

## Introduction

Drone swarms represent a new frontier in robotics, allowing multiple drones to work together to accomplish tasks more efficiently than a single drone could. This project utilizes advanced reinforcement learning techniques to enable drones to learn optimal behaviors in a variety of scenarios. 

The integration of **AirSim** provides a realistic simulation environment, while **StableBaselines3** offers powerful algorithms for training our models. **PettingZoo** helps us manage multi-agent scenarios effectively. 

## Technologies Used

This project employs the following technologies:

- **AirSim**: A simulation platform for drones, enabling realistic physics and environments.
- **Unreal Engine 4 (UE4)**: The game engine that powers AirSim, providing high-quality graphics and physics.
- **StableBaselines3**: A set of reliable implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms.
- **PettingZoo**: A library for multi-agent reinforcement learning environments.
- **SuperSuit**: A library that helps preprocess environments for reinforcement learning.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bensugursoy/Drone-Swarm-RL-airsim-sb3.git
cd Drone-Swarm-RL-airsim-sb3
```

Next, install the required dependencies. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have **AirSim** and **Unreal Engine 4** installed on your machine. Follow the official [AirSim installation guide](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/blob/master/docs/install.md) for detailed instructions.

## Usage

After installing the necessary components, you can start the AirSim simulator. Open the Unreal Engine project and play the simulation. This will launch the AirSim environment where the drones will operate.

To run the training script, execute the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

This will initiate the training process using the PPO algorithm from StableBaselines3. You can modify the training parameters in the `config.py` file to suit your needs.

## Training

Training a drone swarm involves several steps:

1. **Environment Setup**: Configure the simulation environment in Unreal Engine.
2. **Algorithm Selection**: Choose an appropriate reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., PPO).
3. **Training Execution**: Run the training script to begin the learning process.
4. **Evaluation**: Test the trained model in various scenarios to evaluate performance.

### Training Parameters

You can adjust the following parameters in the `config.py` file:

- `num_episodes`: Total number of training episodes.
- `max_steps`: Maximum steps per episode.
- `learning_rate`: Learning rate for the optimizer.
- `gamma`: Discount factor for future rewards.

## Results

After training, you can visualize the results using the provided scripts. The trained models will demonstrate how the drones collaborate to achieve their objectives. You can view performance metrics and graphs to analyze their behavior.
